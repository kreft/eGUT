 * Defines the bulk boundary: the concentration on the boundary is fixed by a dynamical bulk, the agents crossing this line die.
 * This boundary simulates the connection to a larger bulk liquid subject to a dilution process, as would be typical for a reactor. 
 * Behaviour for agents does not differ from the constant concentration boundary case (and so within the computational domain the 
 * boundary condition is identical), but solute dynamics in the bulk compartment require an additional computational step. In this step, 
 * ordinary differential equations describing the reactions occurring in the biofilm and the hydraulic processes affecting the bulk 
 * liquid are solved in order to determine the bulk concentration at the next time-step.
