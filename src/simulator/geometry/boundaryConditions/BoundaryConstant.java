 * BoundaryConstant : the concentration on the boundary is fixed by a constant bulk, the agents crossing this line die. The boundary 
 * represents, for example, the connection to a larger system where the concentration can be considered constant. The solute 
 * concentrations at this boundary are fixed, and agents crossing this boundary are considered to have entered the planktonic bulk 
 * domain.
