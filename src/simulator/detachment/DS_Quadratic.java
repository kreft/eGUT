 * \brief Quadratic detachment method. Function: kDet*L^2, where L is the local biomass thickness

 * The mark-up defines the erosion forces that act on the biofilm surface. Detachment works by removing a layer of biomass based on the 
 * detachment speed and the timestep, with the detachment speed calculated via one of the given forms. This class captures the Quadratic 
 * detachment method.
